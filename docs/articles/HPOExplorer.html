<p>The HPOExplorer package provides useful functions for working with the <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/app/">Human Phenotype Ontology</a>. The main HPO ontology object comes with the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ontologyIndex">ontologyIndex</a> R package. This tutorial will focus on creating an interactive network plot of a subset of the HPO, where disease descriptions and results from your analysis appear in a hover box when a specific phenotype is selected from the graph.</p>

<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#create-dataframe-of-phenotypes-and-parameters" class="anchor"></a>Create dataframe of phenotypes and parameters</h1>
<p>To create the network object we need a dataframe of the selected phenotypes with columns for associated parameters. We will be able to map these parameters onto the colour of the nodes in the figure. We can also use them to subset the selected phenotypes further.</p>
<p>Typically, these parameters would be results from an analysis you have done. For example, you may have p values associated with each phenotype and you might want to only show phenotypes where p&lt;0.05, or use them to colour the nodes, or have the p values displayed in the hover box.</p>
<p>For this example we will have to make up a parameter for demonstration purposes. We are going to divide ontology level of the phenotypes by the number of associated genes. We will also include the ontology level its self and the disease description.</p>
<p>HPOExplorer has some useful functions for obtaining the ontology level of terms. Ontology level describes the number of generations of descendants vertically below a term (note that this is not the same as the raw number of descendants which is also capturing the horizontal spread of branching off terms). For example “Phenotypic abnormality” is high up in the HPO and all other disease phenotypes are descendants of it. It is at ontology level 13. A term with no descendants is at ontology level 0.</p>

<div id="network-object" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#network-object" class="anchor"></a>Network object</h1>
<p>In order to generate the plot we need to coerse the phenos dataframe in to a network object. We use the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=network">network</a> package to do this. It is a way to represent the information about each individual phenotype, as well as the types of relationships between them, all in one data structure.</p>
<p>To set this up we use <code>adjacency_matrix</code> first to create a adjacency matrix of all phenotypes to be plotted. The rows and columns are the phenotypes. If phenotype[i] is a child of phenotype[j] the value in the matrix at matrix[i,j] will be 1. If the two phenotypes are not adjacent to eachother the value will be 0.</p>
<p>Once we have this adjacecny matrix that represents the relationships between phenotypes, we use <code>make_network_object</code> to coerce it into a format suitable for plotting. Essentially this converts the matrix into a dataframe and gives (x,y) coodinates for each data point so that they can be plotted using ggplot.</p>
<p>The <code>colour_column</code> argument is where you choose the column name from the <code>phenos</code> dataframe which you want to be mapped to the colour of the nodes. In this case we created the family arbitrary variable of ontology level to number of associated genes ratio and its column name is <code>ontLvl_geneCount_ratio</code>.</p>

<div id="plot-it" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#plot-it" class="anchor"></a>Plot it</h1>
<p>Then we can make the plot with <code>ggnetwork_plot</code>. Again you need to give the column name for the variable you want mapped to colour in the <code>colour_column</code> argument. We also need to provide a nice label for this column in <code>colour_label</code>. This will be used for the figure legend.</p>
